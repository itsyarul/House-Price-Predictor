# House Price Predictor
A machine learning project built to estimate residential property prices based on key features like location, size, age, and neighborhood attributes. This end-to-end regression pipeline leverages **Linear Regression** along with feature engineering and preprocessing using **scikit-learn**, developed entirely in **Google Colab**.

## Project Highlights
**Predictive Model**: Trained using Linear Regression to estimate house prices from structured tabular data.
**Data Preprocessing**: Includes feature selection, one-hot encoding for categorical values, and modular pipeline construction.**Evaluation**: Performance validated using RÂ² Score, MAE, and RMSE to ensure reliable predictions.
**Sample Dataset**: Synthetic data generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) to simulate real-world housing features.
